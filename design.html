              <hr>
              <p class="text">
                For the purposes of demonstrating how you might use ARENA to manage your own home 
                a replica was created of Patrick's apartment using Blender, a free open-source 3D modeling tool:

                <img class="image center" src="img/interior_wire.PNG" style="max-width: 700px;">
                Once the model is created in Blender, it can be exported in the .glb file format and imported direclty into the ARENA
                scene of your choice, via the <a target="_blank" href="https://arena.conix.io/content/tutorials/filestore.html">ARENA file store</a>:

              <h2>Simulated Data Use</h2>
              <hr>
              <p class="text">
                Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we were quite limited on hardware resources and space and were unable to meet together
                physically over the course of the project's design. Additionally, in terms of hardware, each of us only possessed
                a single Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense (equipped with its various sensors). As a result, we had to simulate some of the
                sensor and feedback data for this project. For example, in the Generalized Heatmaps demo, we read real temperature and humidity data from
                the Arduino as a single source and added some uniform noise in order to simulate having multiple sensors spread out in
                a room.

              <h2>"Generalized Heat Maps" Demo Design</h2>
              <hr>
              <p class="text">
                The goal of our second demo, "Generalized Heat Maps" is to provide
                functionality for mapping out any 3D signal in the space with multiple (simulated) 
                sensors by adding 3D visual effects in the replicated space
