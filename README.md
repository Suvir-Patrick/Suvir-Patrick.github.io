Mixed reality is the idea of combining virtual and real worlds in order to create an environment where both physical
and digital objects exist. This hybrid between reality and virtual reality allows for interaction between the physical
and virtual world. In the past mixed reality has been used in fields such as simulation-bsaed learning, remote learning,
and military training.ARENA is a framework that makes it easy to create and share mixed reality content. 
In the past there have been several technical hurdles that prevented developers from making easily 
accessible mixed reality content including, but not limited to: latency requirements, synchronization 
between multiple users, and a diversity in compute capabilities. Using the ARENA framework, we'd like to 
demonstrate a use case that brings to light the advances made in this area regarding development. Due to the COVID-19
pandemic, our use of spaces is relatively limited. Naturally, the home/apartment becomes a great candidate for mixed 
reality use in this time. Currently, we are planning to replicate a virtual version of our homes. From there, we plan 
on setting up a variety of IoT sensors in the real world around our personal spaces, connecting to them virtually within
ARENA. Anyone with access to the appropriate link can, through a web browser, explore these virtual spaces and interact 
with the physical world themselves. Although management of IoT devices remotely is by no means a novel concept, 
ARENA allows users to do so with a physical touch.
