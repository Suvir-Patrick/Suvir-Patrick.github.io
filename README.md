M202A Project Fall 2020

Abstract:

Mixed reality is the idea of combining virtual and real worlds in order to create an environment where both physical
and digital objects exist. This hybrid between reality and virtual reality allows for interaction between the physical
and virtual worlds. In the past mixed reality has been used in fields such as simulation-based learning, remote learning,
and military training. ARENA is a framework that makes it easy to create and share mixed reality content. 
In the past there have been several technical hurdles that prevented developers from making easily 
accessible mixed reality content including, but not limited to: latency requirements, synchronization 
between multiple users, and a diversity in compute capabilities. Using the ARENA framework, we'd like to 
demonstrate a use case that brings to light the advances made in this area regarding development. Due to the COVID-19
pandemic, our use of spaces is relatively limited. Naturally, the home/apartment becomes a great candidate for mixed 
reality use in this time. Currently, we are planning to replicate a virtual version of our homes. From there, we plan 
on setting up a variety of IoT sensors in the real world around our personal spaces, connecting to them virtually within
ARENA. Anyone with access to the appropriate link can, through a web browser, explore these virtual spaces and interact 
with the physical world themselves. Although management of IoT devices remotely is by no means a novel concept, 
ARENA allows users to do so with a physical touch.

Timeline:

Week 1:

Generally searched for ideas for the project.

Week 2: 

Focused in on the idea of Mixed Reality/Augmented Reality.

Week 3: 

Researched into the ARENA framework and looked into its uses.
Created project github website.

Week 4: 

Completed ARENA tutorial that was presented. Began discussion of using physical sensors with ARENA for interaction.
Completed Proposal and began working on Python code for the project.

Week 5:
Begin background research on Mixed Reality and its implementations. Specifically, research focused on how it could help with simulation-based
learning and remote activity.

Week 6:
Have Python Code written using the ARENA library provided that allows for beta testing of 1 devices.
Begin working on video for presentation.

Week 8: 
Have an implementation fully  tested and working for at least 1 device.
Have 5 minute video presentation ready to show design.

Week 10:
Have all devices intended to be used with the project fully working.
Have a full demo ready to present along with 15 minute video.
