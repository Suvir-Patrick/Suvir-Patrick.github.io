              Hello! This is the project website for "Home IoT Management in ARENA" for 
              ECE M202A (Embedded Systems) for the Fall 2020 quarter. This is a group project completed by
              Patrick Han and Suvir Mehrota under the supervision of Professor Mani Srivastava. Additionally,
              we would like to acknowledge our thanks to Nuno Pereira and Michael Farb at 
              <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cmu.edu/">Carnegie Mellon University</a>
              who were our 2 main points of contact regarding the ARENA framework over the course of this project.
              You'll be able to find links to demonstration videos, source code, and slides on this website.<br>

              Mixed reality is the idea of combining virtual and real worlds in order to create an environment where both physical and digital objects exist. 
              This hybrid between reality and virtual reality allows for interaction between the physical and virtual worlds. 
              In the past mixed reality has been used in fields such as simulation-based learning, remote learning, and military training. 
              ARENA is a framework that makes it easy to create and share mixed reality content. 
              <br>
              <br>
              In the past there have been several 
              technical hurdles that prevented developers from making easily accessible mixed reality content including, but not 
              limited to: latency requirements, synchronization between multiple users, and a diversity in compute capabilities. 
              Using the ARENA framework, we'd like to demonstrate a use case that brings to light the advances made in this area 
              regarding development. 
              <br>
              <br>
              Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, our use of spaces is relatively limited. 
              Naturally, the home/apartment becomes a great candidate for mixed reality use in this time. 
              In this project, we've created two demos that showcase the use of sensing and mixed reality: Generalized Heatmaps and
              Smart Lock Management. Both demos demonstrate how users can interact with internet-connected sensors to enable a greater
              depth of understanding in an environment.
              Anyone with access to the appropriate link can, through a web browser, 
              explore these virtual spaces and interact with the physical world themselves. 
              Although management of IoT devices remotely is by no means a novel concept, ARENA allows users to do so with a 
              physical touch.
